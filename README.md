# Frickl

Frickl is a self-hosted image library. This repository contains the web interface of Frickl written in Vue.js.

## What is Frickl?
- It's free!
- A self-hosted image library
- A way to explore your images through a modern web interface
- A way to make your images available to friends and family
- A way to tag your images for better catalogization and searching
- Easy to set up and run using a Docker container

## What is Frickl not?
- A way to re-organize your photo collection, this needs to be done before using Frickl
- Able to handle deletion/renaming of images in your library, just additions
- Able to handle uploading of images through the web interface, simply add them to the underlying file system
- Currently able to handle any image formats other than .jpg.
- Guarenteed to not screw up your images
- A direct replacement for Flickr or similar, as they host images for you

## A word of warning
Please make sure to make a backup of all your images. I have not experienced any corrupted images during the whole development process, however, I cannot guarantee that this will never happen. You should have a backup of all your important data and images anyway.

## How to use

- Read the [Wiki](../../wiki/) for a variety of options to download and run Frickl yourself.
